The primary aim of  this project was to establish a web-based platform, called Soitinlainaus, to function as a rental marketplace for musical instruments. The purpose of the platform was to facilitate direct transactions between instrument owners and renters, creating a user-friendly interface for both parties. The objective was to provide a seamless and efficient solution where instrument owners can monetize their assets by renting them out, while music enthusiasts can easily discover and rent the instruments they require.

The methods used in the project were C# .NET for the backend logic, Blazor pages for the front-end interface, and an SQLite database for data management. The platform employs a user registration system to grant access to rental services. Individual instrument owners were empowered to post listings on the platform, initiating a direct rental process between the owner (lender) and the renter. The business model revolved around commission-based monetization, with the rental fee determined through mutual agreement between the involved parties. The methods employed ensured a straightforward and interactive experience for users, fostering a peer-to-peer rental marketplace.

As a result, the rental marketplace for musical instruments was successfully implemented as a web-based software solution that effectively connects instrument owners with music enthusiasts in a rental ecosystem. It fulfilled the objectives by providing a valuable and innovative service, allowing instrument owners to monetize their assets, and enabling music enthusiasts to easily access and rent the instruments they seek. The platform's user-friendly interface enhances accessibility for both owners and renters, streamlining the process of posting instrument listings and initiating transactions. The direct facilitation of rental transactions between users promotes a sense of autonomy and flexibility. The commission-based business model has proven to be a viable means of revenue generation for the platform. 

This was my last schoolproject and I have touched almost every aspect of this project.
